{"name":"Wells Fargo Analytics Competition","tagline":"","body":"### Objectives\r\nThe initial objectives of the competition were to find and associate different words with different banks.  As a group, the main focus was on the positive and negative words associated with each bank.  After these were generated, we created a word cloud for each bank with a heat map, highlighting which words were positive and which were negative.\r\n\r\n### Focus\r\n    There were main points that were focused on as we went through the coding;\r\n          * Complaints of unfair policies/fees/charges \r\n          * Customer attrition \r\n          * Unresolved issues \r\n          * Appeal to higher authority\r\n          * Negative perceptions of services rendered\r\n\r\n### Conclusions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPage created by Tyler Walter.  Data and coding performed by Neal Sakash, Chase Hendley, Don Cole, and Tyler Walter.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
